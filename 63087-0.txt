PREFACE


The motive of this work is THE STANDARDIZATION OF COLORS AND COLOR
NAMES.

The terminology of Science, the Arts, and various Industries has been
a most important factor in the development of their present high
efficiency. Measurements, weights, mathematical and chemical formulæ,
and terms which clearly designate practically every variation of form
and structure have long been standardized; but the nomenclature of
colors remains vague and, for practical purposes, meaningless, thereby
seriously impeding progress in almost every branch of industry and
research.

Many works on the subject of color have been published, but most of
them are purely technical, and pertain to the physics of color, the
painter's needs, or to some particular art or industry alone, or in
other ways are unsuited for the use of the zoologist, the botanist,
the pathologist, or the mineralogist; and the comparatively few
works on color intended specially for naturalists have all failed to
meet the requirements, either because of an insufficient number of
color samples, lack of names or other means of easy identification
or designation, or faulty selection and classification of the colors
chosen for illustration. More than twenty years ago the author of the
present work attempted to supply the deficiency by the publication
of a book[1] containing 186 samples of named colors, but the effort
was successful only to the extent that it was an improvement on its
predecessors; and, although still the standard of color nomenclature
among zoologists and many other naturalists, it nevertheless is
seriously defective in the altogether inadequate number of colors
represented, and in their unscientific arrangement. Fully realizing his
failure, the author, some two or three years later, began to devise
plans, gather materials, and acquire special knowledge of the subject,
in the hope that he might some day be able to prepare a new work which
would fully meet the needs of all who have use for it. Unfortunately,
his time has been so fully occupied with other matters that progress
has necessarily been slow; but after more than twenty years of sporadic
effort it has at last been completed.

Acknowledgments are due to so many friends for helpful suggestions
that it is hardly possible to name them all, or to specify the extent
or kind of help which each has rendered; but special mention should be
made of Mr. LEWIS E. JEWELL, of Johns Hopkins University; Dr. R. M.
STRONG, of the University of Chicago; Prof. W. J. SPILLMAN, of the U.
S. Department of Agriculture; Mr. WILLIAMS WELCH, of the U. S. Signal
Service; Mr. MILTON BRADLEY, of Springfield, Mass.; Dr. P. G. NUTTING,
of the U. S. Bureau of Standards; Mr. P. L. RICKER, of the Bureau of
Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture; and Mr. J. L. RIDGWAY,
of the U. S. Geological Survey. The late Professor S. P. LANGLEY, then
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was good enough to take a
kindly interest in this undertaking and gave the author assistance
for which he is glad to make acknowledgment. More than to all others,
however, is the author deeply indebted to Mr. John E. THAYER, of
Lancaster, Mass., and Señor Don JOSÉ C. ZELEDÓN, of San José, Costa
Rica, for aid so indispensible that without it the work could not have
been completed.

To Dr. G. GRÜBLER & CO., of Leipzig, Germany, the author is under
obligations for the gift of a nearly complete set of their celebrated
coal-tar dyes, which have proven quite necessary to the work,
especially in the coloring of the Maxwell disks on which the color
scheme is based.

The reproduction of the plates has been a difficult matter, involving
not only expensive experimentation, but more than three years of
unremitting labor. Vastly different from the ordinary lines of
commercial color work, the correct copying of each one of the 1115
colors of the original plates developed many perplexing and often
discouraging problems, which were finally solved through Mr. A. B.
HOEN'S expert knowledge of chemistry and pigments; the skill, industry,
and patience of the firm's head colorist, Mr. FRANK PORTUGAL, and the
personal interest of both these gentlemen. It is, therefore, with the
greatest pleasure that the author's grateful acknowledgment is made to
the firm of A. HOEN & COMPANY for the satisfactory manner in which they
have fulfilled their contract.

PROLOGUE


As stated in the Preface, the purpose of this work is the
standardization of colors and color nomenclature, so that naturalists
or others who may have occasion to write or speak of colors may do so
with the certainty that there need be no question as to what particular
tint, shade, or degree of grayness, of any color or hue is meant.
Therefore, it is unnecessary to treat of the subject from any other
point of view; it will be sufficient to say that this work is based
on a thorough study of the subject from every standpoint, and that
practically all authoritative works on the subject of color have been
carefully consulted.[2]


PLAN. —The scientific arrangement of colors in this work is based
essentially on the suggestions of Professor J. H. Pillsbury for a
scheme of color standards,[3] which have also been the basis of several
other efforts toward the same end, as the plates in Milton Bradley's
"Elementary Color" and educational colored papers, Prang's charts of
standard colors, Klinkseick and Valette's "Code des Couleurs," etc.;
but while all these present a scientifically arranged color-scheme and
more or less adequate number of colors they all fail to supply a ready
or convenient means of identifying and designating the colors—the
principal utility of a work of this kind. It is in the latter respect
that the present work is believed to meet, more nearly than any other
at least, this essential requirement, and in this consists whatever
originality may be claimed for it.

The "key" to the classification or arrangement herewith presented is,
of course, the solar spectrum, with its six fundamental colors and
intermediate hues, augmented by the series of hues connecting violet
with red, which the spectrum fails to show. If, with the red-violets
and violet-reds thus added to the spectrum hues, the band forming
this scale be joined end to end a circle is formed in which there is
continuously a gradual change of hue, step by step, from red through
orange-red and red-orange to orange; orange through yellow-orange and
orange-yellow to yellow; yellow through green-yellow and yellow-green
to green; green through blue-green and green-blue to blue; blue through
violet-blue and blue-violet to violet; and violet through red-violet
and violet-red to red—the starting-point—with intermediate connecting
hues. In the solar spectrum, both prismatic and grating, but especially
the former, the spaces between the adjoining distinct colors are very
unequal; therefore for the present purpose an ideal scale must be
constructed, so that an approximately equal number of equally distinct
connecting hues shall be shown. Distinctions of hue appreciable to the
normal eye are so very numerous[4] that the criterion of convenience
or practicability must determine the number of segments into which the
ideal chromatic scale or circle may be divided in order to best serve
the purpose in view. Careful experiment seems to have demonstrated
that thirty-six is the practicable limit, and accordingly that number
has been adopted.[5] If the number of intermediate hues were equal
in all cases there would, in this scheme, be five between each two
adjacent fundamental colors of the spectrum; but a greater number of
recognizably distinct hues is obviously necessary in some cases than in
others; for example, spectrum orange is decidedly nearer in hue to red
than to yellow, and therefore the number of intermediates required on
each side of the orange is different, being in the proportion of four
for the red-orange series to five for the orange-yellow, and similarly
six are required for the violet-red series, while four suffice for the
blue-violet hues.

There is no known means by which we can measure the proportion of
two or more _pigments_ in any given mixture, "because color-effect
cannot be measured by the pint of mixed paint or the ounce of dry
pigment;"[6] but, fortunately, we have a very exact method, in the
color-wheel and Maxwell disks, by which the relative proportions of
two or more _colors_ in any mixture may be precisely measured. This
method has been used in the painting of every one of the 1115 colors
of the present work, by means of one disk to represent each one of the
thirty-six colors (both pure and "broken"), together with a black, a
white, and a neutral gray disk, the last being a match in color to
the gray resulting from the mixture of red, green and violet on the
color-wheel;[7] the neutral gray disk, however, being used only for
the making of disks for the broken series of colors (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′,
and ′′′′′) and for the scale of neutral grays (Plate LIII.) These
colored disks are slit on one side from center to circumference, and
therefore by interlocking two or more they may be adjusted so that
either occupies any desired percentage of the whole area, which may be
very precisely determined by a scale of 100 segments shown on the outer
edge of a larger disk on which the colored disks are superimposed. When
connected with the color-wheel and adjusted as may be desired, and then
rapidly revolved, the two or more distinct colors resolve themselves
into a single uniform composite color, whose elements are shown, in
their relative proportion, by the scale surrounding the disks.[8]

The scales (both horizontal and vertical) of the present work are
all prepared directly from definite color-wheel formulæ, based on
carefully calculated curves; the thirty-six pure spectrum hues,
represented by the middle horizontal line of color-squares on Plates
I-XII (together with an equal number of intermediates represented by
blank spaces), requiring a separate curve and consequently different
relative proportions of the two component colors for each series
of hues—that is, the series from red to orange, orange to yellow,
yellow to green, green to blue, blue to violet, and violet to red,
respectively; but the progressive increments of white in the scales
of tints, black in those of shades, and neutral gray in the several
series of broken colors are exactly the same in every case. The first
series of Plates (I-XII) shows the pure, full spectrum colors and
intermediate hues (middle horizontal line, nos. 1-72),[9] each with its
vertical scale of tints (upward, _a-g_) and shades (downward, _h-n_),
the increments of white for the tints being 9.5, 22.5, and 45 per
cent., respectively, those of black in the shades being 45, 70.5, and
87.5 per cent. The remaining Plates show these same thirty-six colors
or hues in exactly the same order and similarly modified (vertically)
by precisely the same progressive increments of white (upward) and
black (downward), but all the colors are dulled by admixture of neutral
gray; the first series (1′-72′, Plates XIII-XXVI) containing 32 per
cent. of neutral gray, the second (1′′-72′′, Plates XXVII-XXXVIII) 58
per cent., the third (1′′′-72′′′, Plates XXXIX-XLIV) 77 per cent.,
and the fourth (1′′′′-72′′′′, Plates XLV-L) 90 per cent. The last
three Plates (LI-LIII) show the six spectrum colors[10] (also purple,
the intermediate between violet and red) still further dulled by
admixture of 95.5 per cent. of neutral gray, these being in reality
colored grays; to which are added a scale of neutral gray and one of
carbon gray, the former being the gray resulting from mixture of the
three primary colors (red 32, green 42, violet 26 per cent., which in
relative darkness equals black 79.5, white 20.5 per cent.); the latter
being the gray produced by mixture of lamp black and Chinese white, and
the scale a reproduction of that in the author's first "Nomenclature of
Colors" (1886, Plate II, nos. 2-10). It should be emphasized that in
all cases except the scale of carbon grays, only the disks representing
the middle horizontal series of colors (both pure and broken) have been
used, in combination with a black and a white disk, respectively, to
make the colors of the vertical scales of tints and shades.

The coloring of a satisfactory set of disks to represent the thirty-six
pure spectrum colors and hues was a matter of extreme difficulty, many
hundreds having been painted and discarded before the desired result
was achieved. Several serious problems were involved, the matter of
change of hue through chemical reaction of the combined pigments or
dyes[11] (especially the latter) being almost as troublesome as that
of securing the proper degree of difference between each adjoining
pair of hues. The method by which satisfactory results were finally
secured was as follows: First, six disks were colored to represent
each of the fundamental spectrum colors, according to the author's
conception of them.[12] These six disks were then placed against a
suitable background (a neutral gray), in spectrum sequence, with wide
intervals for the accommodation of connecting series of disks, which
were then colored so as to represent an apparently even transition
from one to the other. When this very difficult task had been done as
well as the eye alone could judge, each intermediate was then measured
on the color-wheel and the relative proportions (in percentages) of
its two component colors recorded. After this had been done for all
the intermediate hues each series (the red-orange, orange-yellow,
yellow-green, green-blue, blue-violet, and violet-red) was taken
separately and a curve constructed on cross-section paper from the
recorded ratios. These curves were found to be in all cases more or
less irregular or unsymmetrical, but nevertheless were sufficiently
near correct to serve as a basis for a symmetrical curve; and after the
points out of proper line were suitably relocated the two component
colors were correspondingly readjusted on the color-wheel and each
faulty disk corrected (or a new one painted) until it exactly matched
the required combination. The scales representing the tints and shades
of each color, and also the gray or broken colors were similarly
determined by corrected curves.[13]

By the method adopted of running each of the thirty-six spectrum hues
through a scale of tints and shades, and repeating the combination
through several series modified by increasing increments of neutral
gray, practically the entire possible range of color variation is
covered,[14] rendering it an easy matter to locate in the plates,
either among the colors actually shown or in an intermediate space,
any color which it is desired to match; and where short distinctive
names have not been found (their place being, tentatively, supplied by
compound names), as, necessarily, must often be the case, any color
or intermediate between any two colors, either as to hue, tint, or
shade, may be readily designated by the very simple system of symbols
(numerals and letters) employed.[15]

In order to designate any color for which a satisfactory name cannot
be found, or one not represented on the plates, it is only necessary
to proceed as follows: Suppose the color in question is nearest 1 on
Plate I; say, for example, is intermediate in hue between 1 (spectrum
red) and 3 (scarlet-red), or in other words if represented in color its
position would be in the uncolored space designated as no. 2; and in
tone between the full color (middle horizontal line) and tint _b_. Its
designation, therefore, is _2a_. Exactly the same method applies to any
of the other blank spaces, as well as to the colors themselves, except
that in case of the broken colors the "primes" (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′, or
′′′′′) are to be affixed to the hue number. First locate the _hue_,
designated by number, then the _tone_, designated by lower case letter,
the full, pure colors of the middle horizontal row being designated by
number alone.

Color Names.—While it is true that the naming of colors as usually
employed has so little to do with the purely technical aspects of
chromatology or color-physics that, as Von Bezold remarks[16] "we are
in reality dealing with the peculiarities of language," it is equally
true that a collection of color standards designed expressly for the
purpose of identifying and designating particular colors can best
attain this object by the use of a carefully selected nomenclature.
In other words, the prime necessity is to standardize both colors and
color names, by elimination of the element of "personal equation"
in the matter. In no other way can agreement be reached as to the
distinction between "violet" and "purple," two color names quite
generally used interchangeably or synonymously but in reality belonging
to quite distinct hues, or that any other color name can be definitely
fixed. Various methods of handling the matter of color in zoological
and botanical descriptions, etc., by the avoidance of color names and
substitution therefor of symbols, numerals, or mechanical contrivances
(as color-wheel and spectrum analyses, color-spheres, etc.) have been
devised but all have been found impracticable or unsatisfactory.
The author has taken the trouble to get an expression of opinion in
this matter from many naturalists and others, and the preference for
color-names very greatly predominates; consequently, whenever it has
been possible to find a name which seems suitable for any color in
this work it has been done, leaving as few as possible unnamed, and
for these some other means must be devised for their designation. (See
page 8). The selection of appropriate names for the colors depicted on
the Plates has been in some cases a matter of considerable difficulty.
With regard to certain ones it may appear that the names adopted are
not entirely satisfactory; but, to forestall such criticism, it may be
explained that the purpose of these Plates is not to show the color
of the particular objects or substances which the names suggest, but
to provide appropriate, or at least approximately appropriate, names
for the colors which it has seemed desirable to represent. In other
words, certain colors are selected for illustration, for which names
must be provided; and when names that are exclusively pertinent or
otherwise entirely satisfactory are not at hand, they must be looked
up or invented. It should also be borne in mind that almost any object
or substance varies more or less in color; and that therefore if
the "orange," "lemon," "chestnut" or "lilac" of the Plates does not
exactly match in color the particular orange, lemon, chestnut or lilac
which one may compare it with, it may (in fact does) correspond with
other specimens. Without standardization, even if arbitrary, color
nomenclature must, necessarily, remain in its present condition of
absolute chaos. Even the standard pigments are not constant in color,
practically every one of them being subject to more or less variation
in hue or tone, different samples from the same manufacturer sometimes
varying to the extent of several tones or hues of the present work;
indeed, in every case where two or more samples of the same color
have been compared it has been found that no two are exactly alike,
the difference often being very great. For example: Of five samples
of "vandyke brown" only two are approximately similar, each of the
other three being widely different, not only from one another but from
the other two, one being a blackish brown, another reddish brown, the
third a yellowish orange-brown. Of eleven samples of "olive" no two
are closely similar, the color ranging from a shade of dull (grayish)
blue-green to orange-brown, dark brownish gray, and light yellowish
olive; and the same or nearly the same degree of variation is seen
in absolutely every color examined, showing very clearly the utter
worthlessness of color names unless fixed or standardized.

In order to obtain as many color names as possible for standardization
it has been necessary to draw from all available sources. Several
thousand samples of named colors have therefore been collected, and
for convenience of reference and comparison gummed to card catalogue
cards, with the name, source, and other data thereon. These include
the colors from many standard works, among them Werner's "Nomenclature
of Colours" (Syme's edition, 1821), Hay's "Nomenclature of Colours"
(1846), Ridgway's "Nomenclature of Colors" (1886), Saccardo's
"Chromataxia" (1891), Mathews' "Chart of Correct Colors of Flowers"
(American Florist, 1891), Willson and Calkins' "Familiar Colors,"
Oberthur and Dauthenay's "Repertoire des Couleurs" (1905), Leidel's
"Hints on Tints" (1893), "Lefévré's Matieres Colorantes Artificiales"
(1896), the Standard Dictionary chart of "typical colors," the
educational colored papers of Milton Bradley and Prang, and many
others; and besides these practically all of the artists' oil, water,
and dry colors, manufactured by Winsor and Newton, F. Schoenfeld and
Co., Charles Roberson and Co., George Rowney and Co., Madderton and
Co., R. Ackermann and Co., Bourgeois, Binant, Chenal, Le Franc, Devoe,
Raynolds, Osborne, Bradley, Hatfield and others; also the coal-tar or
aniline dyes of Dr. G. Grübler & Co., Continental Color and Chemical
Co., and Henry Heil Chemical Co., and the well known Diamond Dyes;
chromo-lithographic inks, embroidery silks, etc., etc.

The material from which to select suitable color names was greatly
augmented, almost at the last moment, from two sources, as follows: (1)
A very large collection of color-samples (unfortunately mostly unnamed)
collected and mounted on cards by Mr. Frederick A. Wampole, a talented
young artist, to whom was delegated, by a Committee of the American
Mycological Society, the task of preparing a nomenclature of colors
based upon spectroscopic determinations, but which, unfortunately,
the untimely death of Mr. Wampole prevented from progressing beyond
the accumulation of this collection. For the use of this material I
am indebted to the courtesy of Dr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist of
the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and Mr. P. L. Ricker, Assistant
Botanist, Bureau of Plant Industry, in the same Department. (2) A
splendid collection of colored Japanese silks, taffetas, velvets, and
other dress goods, kindly sent me by Mr. C. H. Hospital, of the silk
department of the firm of Woodward and Lothrop, Washington, D. C. The
very large number of colors represented in this collection are all
named and have afforded a considerable number of the names adopted in
the present work.

For obvious reasons it has, of course, been necessary to ignore many
trade names, through which the popular nomenclature of colors has
become involved in really chaotic confusion rendered more confounded
by the continual coinage of new names, many of them synonymous and
most of them vague and variable in their application. Most of them
are invented, apparently without care or judgment, by the dyer or
manufacturer of fabrics, and are as capricious in their meaning as in
their origin; for example: Such fanciful names as "zulu," "serpent
green," "baby blue," "new old rose," "London smoke," etc., and such
nonsensical names as "ashes of roses" and "elephant's breath." An
inspection of the sample books of manufacturers of fancy goods (such
as embroidery silks and crewels, ribbons, velvets, and other dress-
and upholstery-goods) is sufficient not only to illustrate the
above observations, but to show also the absolute want of system or
classification and the general unavailability of these trade names for
adoption in a practical color nomenclature. This is very unfortunate,
since many of these trade names have the merit of brevity and euphony
and lack only the quality of stability.

It has been difficult for the author to decide whether the standards
of his original "Nomenclature of Colors" (1886) should be retained
in the present work. Some of them are admittedly wrong (indeed,
certain ones are not as they were intended to be); besides, owing to
the method of reproducing the originals (hand stenciling) there is
considerable variation in different copies of the book, one or more
reprints, necessitating new mixtures of pigments, adding to this lack
of uniformity.[17] Many persons, however, have urged the retention of
the old standards, on the ground that they have been used by so many
zoologists and botanists in their writings during the last twenty-five
years that they have become established through common usage. This
very important consideration has induced the author to retain such of
the old standards as can be matched in the present work, even though
some of them do not agree strictly with either his own or the usual
conception of the colors in question. An asterisk (*) preceding a color
name indicates that the name in question is adopted from the older
work, the variation between different copies of the work requiring
the selection, in the new one, of a color representing as nearly as
possible an average of the former.

In any systematically arranged scheme, unless the number of colors
shown is practically unlimited, it will, necessarily, be impossible
to find represented thereon a certain proportion of colors comprised
among even a very limited number selected at random, or only roughly
classified. Hence many (thirty-six, or more than five per cent.) of the
colors shown in the old "Nomenclature of Colors" fall into the blank
intervals of the present work, being intermediate either in hue or
tone, or chroma, sometimes all. It is necessary of course to provide
some means for the correlation of these with the present scheme, which
is done by the list on page 41, where the position of each is shown.

The question of giving representations of metallic colors in this
work was at one time considered; but the idea was abandoned for the
reason that these are in reality only ordinary colors reflected from
a metallic or burnished surface, or appearing as if so reflected; the
actual hue is precisely the same, though often changeable according to
angle of impact of the light rays, and relative position of the eye,
this changeableness being sometimes due to interference.[18] Colors
again vary, without actual difference of hue, in regard to quality of
texture or surface; that is to say, the color may be quite lustreless,
appearing on a dull, sometimes velvety surface, while again it may be
more or less glossy, even to the degree of appearing as if varnished.
To deal with these variations, however, requires simply the use of
suitable adjectives. For example: To indicate a color which has no
lustre or brightness, the adjective matt (or mat) may be used, in
preference to _dull_, which implies reduction in purity or chroma;
other adjectives, appropriate in special cases, being velvety, glossy,
burnished metallic, matt-metallic, etc.

Color Terms.—No other person has presented so forcibly the urgent need
for reform in popular nomenclature nor stated so clearly and concisely
its shortcomings and the simple remedy, as Mr. Milton Bradley, from
one of whose educational pamphlets on the subject[19] the following is
quoted: "The list of words now employed to express qualities or degrees
of color is very small, in fact a half dozen comprise the more common
terms, and these are pressed into service on all occasions, and in such
varied relations that they not only fail to express anything definite
but constantly contradict themselves.... Tint, Hue and Shade are
employed so loosely by the public generally, even by those people who
claim to use English correctly, that neither word has a very definite
meaning, although each is capable of being as accurately used as any
other word in our every day vocabulary"....

Certainly one would expect that men of learning, at least, would employ
the broader color terms correctly; but some of the highest authorities
on color-physics habitually use them interchangeably, as if they were
quite synonymous; and even the dictionaries, with few exceptions, give
incorrect or "hazy" definitions of these terms. It is not strictly
correct to say a "dark tint" or "light shade" of any color, because a
_tint_ implies a color _paler_ than the full color, while a shade means
exactly the opposite; and to say an "orange shade (or tint) of red,"
a "greenish shade (or tint) of blue," a "bluish shade (or tint) of
violet," etc., is an absurdity, for the term _hue_, which specifically
and alone refers to relative position in the spectrum scale, without
reference to lightness or darkness, is the only one which can correctly
be used in such cases.

Indeed the standardization of color terms is almost if not quite
as important, in the interest of educational progress, as that of
the colors themselves and their names; therefore, to make easy a
clear understanding of the specific meaning of each, the following
definitions are given:—

_Color._—The term of widest application, being the only one which can
be used to cover the entire range of chromatic manifestation; that is
to say, the spectrum colors (together with those between violet and
red, not shown in the spectrum) with all their innumerable variations
of luminosity, mixture, etc. In a more restricted sense, applied to the
six distinct spectrum colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and
violet), which are sometimes distinguished as _fundamental colors_ or
_spectrum colors_.

_Hue._—While often used interchangeably or synonymously with color,
the term _hue_ is more properly restricted by special application
to those lying between any contiguous pair of spectrum colors (also
between violet and purple and between purple and red); as an orange
_hue_ (not shade or tint, as so often incorrectly said) of red; a
yellow _hue_ of orange; a greenish _hue_ of yellow; a bluish _hue_ of
green; a violet _hue_ of blue, etc.

_Tint._—Any color (pure or broken) weakened by high illumination or
(in the case of pigments) by admixture of white, or (in the case of
dyes or washes) by excess of aqueous or other liquid medium; as, a
deep, medium, light, pale or delicate (pallid) _tint_ of red. The term
cannot correctly be used in any other sense.

_Shade._—Any color (pure or broken) darkened by shadow or (in the case
of pigments) by admixture of black; exactly the opposite of _tint_; as
a medium, dark, or very dark (dusky) _shade_ of red.

_Tone._—"Each step in a color scale is a tone of that color."[20]
The term tone cannot, however, be properly applied to a step in the
spectrum scale, in which each contiguous pair of the six distinct
spectrum or "fundamental" _colors_ are connected by _hues_. Hence
_tone_[21] is exclusively applicable to the steps in a scale of
a single color or hue, comprising the full color (in the center)
and graduated tints and shades leading off therefrom in opposite
directions; or of neutral gray similarly graduated in tone from the
darkest shade to the palest tint. Each one of the colored blocks in the
vertical scales of the plates in this work represents a separate tone
of that color.

_Scale._—A linear series of colors showing a gradual transition from
one to another, or a similar series of tones of one color. The first
is a _chromatic scale_[22] (or scale of colors and hues) and in the
plates of this work is represented by each horizontal series; the
second is a _tone scale_, on the plates running vertically, growing
from the full color, in the center, to a pale tint (at the top) and
a dark shade (at the bottom). For clearer comprehension of these
two distinct scales, each plate of this work may be compared to a
sheet of woven fabric; the chromatic scale (horizontal) representing
the warp, the luminosity or tone scale (vertical) the woof. A third
kind of color scale is represented by adding progressive increments
of neutral gray to any color. This is shown by the several series
of Plates, of which the first (Plates I-XII, with colors numbered
1-71) represents each step in the spectrum scale unmixed with gray,
followed by five other series in which the same colors[23] are shown
dulled by gradually increasing increments of neutral gray, the first
(Plates XIII-XXVI, colors 1′-71′) containing 32 per cent., the second
(Plates XXVII-XXXVIII, colors 1′′-71′′) 58 per cent., the third (Plates
XXXIX-XLIV, colors 1′′′-69′′′) 77 per cent., the fourth (Plates XLV-L,
colors 1′′′′-69′′′′) 90 per cent., and the fifth (Plates LI-LIII,
colors 1′′′′′, 15′′′′′, 23′′′′′, 35′′′′′, 49′′′′′, 59′′′′′ and 67′′′′′)
95.5 per cent. of gray, the last being in reality colored grays.
Finally scales are shown (on Plate LIII) of neutral gray (in which
all trace of color is wanting), and of carbon gray, a simple mixture
of lamp-black and chinese white. It is not easy to find a suitable
name for these scales of reduced or "broken" colors, but they may, for
present convenience, be termed _reduced_ or _broken scales_.

_Full Color._—A color corresponding in intensity with its
manifestation in the solar spectrum.

_Pure Color._—A color corresponding in purity with (or, in the case of
material colors, closely approximating to) one of the spectrum colors.

_Broken Color._—Any one of the spectrum colors or hues dulled or
reduced in purity by admixture (in any proportion) of neutral gray, or
varying relative proportions of both black and white; also produced
by admixture of certain spectrum colors, as red with green, orange
with blue, yellow with violet, etc. These broken colors are far more
numerous in Nature than the pure spectrum colors, and include the
almost infinite variations of brown, russet, citrine, olive, drab, etc.
They are often called dull or neutral colors.

_Fundamental Colors._—The six psychologically distinct colors of the
solar spectrum; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet.

_Primary Colors._—Theoretically, any of the spectrum colors which
cannot be made by mixture of two other colors. According to the
generally accepted Young-Helmholtz theory, the primary colors are
red, green, and violet: orange and yellow resulting from a mixture of
red and green, and blue from a mixture of green and violet. There is
considerable difference of opinion, however, as to this question, and
further investigation of the subject seems to be required; at any rate,
authorities fail to explain why red may be exactly reproduced (except
as to the degree of luminosity) by a mixture of orange and violet,
exactly as yellow results from mixture of red and green or blue from
green or violet, green being, in fact, the only spectrum color that
cannot be made by mixture of other colors.[24]

_Chroma._—Degree of freedom from white light; purity, intensity or
fullness of color.

_Luminosity._—Degree of brightness or clearness. The relative
luminosity of the spectrum colors is as follows: [Yellow (brightest)?],
orange yellow; orange; greenish-yellow, yellow-green, and green;
orange-red; red and blue (equal); violet-blue, blue-violet, violet.[25]

_Warm Colors._—The colors nearer the red end of the spectrum or those
of longer wave-lengths (red, orange, and yellow, and connecting hues)
"and combinations in which they predominate."[26]

_Cool, or Cold, Colors._—The colors nearer the violet end of
the spectrum or those of shorter wave-length, especially blue and
green-blue. "But it is, perhaps, questionable whether green and violet
may be termed either warm or cool."

_Complementary Color._—"As white light is the sum of all color, if
we take from white light a given color the remaining color is the
complement of the given color." When any two colors or hues which when
combined in proper proportion on the color-wheel produce, by rotation,
neutral gray, these two colors each represent the complementary of the
other.

_Constants of Color._—The constants of color are numbers which measure
(1) the wave-length, (2) the chroma, and (3) the luminosity.

In addition to the terms defined above there are many others, for which
the reader is referred to the chapter on "Color Definitions" on pages
23-30 of Milton Bradley's excellent and most useful book "Elementary
Color."

One of the most serious difficulties encountered in the preparation
of the Plates of this work was the apparent impracticability of
reproducing satisfactory shades of pure colors. This originated in the
fact that there seems to be no substance (pigment, dye, or fabric)
which represents a true black, all reflecting more or less of white
light, and consequently producing shades which are dull or broken.
The difficulty is increased by the additional fact that any black
pigment mixed with almost any color falls short of even the color-wheel
mixture in purity of hue in the resulting shades, owing to the very
considerable amount of gray in all black pigments. Chromolithography
can be made to produce clearer and better shades of the pure colors,
but is distinctly objectionable for the purpose of a work of this
kind owing to eventual oxidation of the oil or varnish with which the
pigments are combined in lithographic inks, causing a change of hue;
reds becoming more orange, blues more greenish, etc., in course of time.

While the absence (in large part) of pure chromatic shades is much
to be regretted, the defect is not so serious, _from the standpoint
of utility_, as might appear at first sight; for while saturated or
darkened pure colors are not uncommon in the animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms, more or less broken dark colors are infinitely more
so; and since the latter are greatly increased in number by the defect
mentioned the actual result is rather an advantage than otherwise.

It will doubtless be noticed that there is a conspicuous difference
in relative darkness between shades of yellow and contiguous hues on
the one hand and corresponding ones of violet and adjacent hues on the
other, as if the percentage of black in each were very different. This,
however, is entirely the result of difference of luminosity of the
two sets of colors, that of yellow being between 7000 and 8000 while
that of violet is only about 13;[28] for the percentage of black in
corresponding tones of the vertical scales is precisely the same for
each color throughout the chromatic scale of this work.




TABLE SHOWING PERCENTAGES OF NEUTRAL GRAY IN THE BROKEN COLOR SCALES.


Every Plate in each series of broken colors (′ to ′′′′′) contains
exactly the same percentage of neutral gray in each color, the relative
amount increasing progressively in the several series, as shown in the
following table. The percentages of white in the tints and of black in
the shades of the tone scales are in all cases exactly the same as in
the tone scales of pure colors.

_Note._—The percentages given in the preceding tables may not in
all cases be precisely those actually contained in the colors on the
Plates, since absolute precision in reproduction is hardly possible.
All that can be claimed is a reasonably close approximation to the
ideal.




DYES AND PIGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE MAXWELL DISKS,
REPRESENTING THE THIRTY-SIX COLORS OF THE PURE SPECTRUM SCALE, FORMING
THE BASIS OF THE COLOR-SCHEME OF THIS WORK.[29]


=Red.=—Devoe's _geranium lake_ (dry), its orange hue neutralized by a
wash of _rhodamin b._ (_Crocein scarlet b._ washed with _rhodamin b._
produces practically the same fine red.)

=Hues between red and orange.=—_Crocein scarlet b._ with _gold orange_.

=Orange.=—_Gold orange_ with _orange g._

=Hues between orange and yellow.=—_Orange g._ with _auramin_.

=Yellow.=—_Auramin_, rather dilute. (The best substitute among pigments
is a fine quality of _zinc yellow_, as Hatfield's.)

=Hues between yellow and green.=—_Auramin_ washed with _light green_.

=Green.=—_Auramin_ (very dilute) washed with _light green_. (The
auramin should be applied first, because it "sets" or becomes fast
quickly, while the light green does not, but is largely removed by
overwashes of the yellow, thus rendering it very difficult to get the
desired hue.)

=Hues between green and blue.=—_Methyl green_; the same washed with
_light blue_ (Diamond Dye); for the hues nearer blue, _light blue_
washed with Winsor and Newton's _permanent blue_ or _new blue_ (the
least violet-hued of the artificial ultramarines).

=Blue.=—_Light blue_ washed with _permanent blue_ or _new blue_.
(Although the color is nearer that of the artificial ultramarines
named, it is useless to apply the latter first, for overwashes of the
light blue merely sink through and darken the color without improving
the hue. A moderately saturated solution of the light blue should be
applied first, and when this is dry covered with one or more rather
thin washes of the permanent blue or new blue).

=Hues between blue and violet.=—Winsor and Newton's _permanent blue_
and some of the more violet-hued artificial ultramarines, the hues
nearer violet washed with _crystal violet_ or _gentian violet_.

=Violet.=—_Crystal violet._

=Hues between violet and red.=—_Methyl violet 1b._ washed with
_rhodamin b._; for hues nearer red, _rhodamin b._ with Devoe's
_geranium red_ (dry) or _crocein scarlet b._

While more or less similar in hue to rhodamin b., several other aniline
dyes, as _acid fuchsin_, _rubin s._, _rosein_, _magenta_, etc., do not
combine satisfactorily with the violets, the mixture soon becoming dark
or dull and none of them are quite as pure a purple or red-violet.

It is most important to remember that disks thus colored must be
carefully protected from light when not in actual use and _never_
exposed to direct sunlight. The artificial ultramarines are, of course,
permanent, and so, practically, are crocein scarlet, gold orange,
orange g., and auramin—that is to say, are not materially affected
by the action of light except after very prolonged exposure, though
the last named undergoes a change of hue; but the green and violet
aniline dyes are all very evanescent, rapidly fading and eventually
disappearing; light blue and rhodamin, while sensitive to light, are
far less so than the greens and violets.

A FEW OF THE MODERN BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT OF COLOR WHICH THE AUTHOR OF
THIS WORK HAS FOUND MOST USEFUL


_Bradley, Milton_, author of "Color in the Schoolroom" and "Color in
the Kindergarden."—Elementary Color. With an Introduction by Henry
Lafavour, Ph. D., Professor of Physics, Williams College. Milton
Bradley and Co., Springfield, Mass. [1895]. Small 8vo., pp. [i]-iv,
[1]-128; colored frontispiece ("miniature color charts made from the
Bradley educational colored papers," showing 126 unnamed colors) and
numerous figures in text.

The present writer frankly and gratefully acknowledges that he has
learned more, and learned it more easily, from this little book, which
is a model of conciseness and perspicuity, than from careful study of
more elaborate and authoritative works on the subject. It is therefore
most heartily recommended to the student as a preliminary, at least, to
the study of more technical works on color.

The colored plates of this excellent work illustrate the physics and
psychology of color, color harmonies, and kindred subjects, but have no
relation to color nomenclature.

colored plates contained in double box.

An exceedingly useful work for artists and decorators, but not adapted
to the needs of science. The technical execution of the plates is
exquisite and the colors very fine.




FOOTNOTES


[1] A | Nomenclature of Colors | for Naturalists, | and | Compendium
of Useful Knowledge | for Ornithologists. | By | Robert Ridgway, |
Curator, Department of Birds, United States National Museum. | With ten
colored plates and seven plates | of outline illustrations. | Boston: |
Little, Brown, and Company. | 1886. | (12mo., pp. 129, pls. 17.)

The subject of color and color nomenclature discussed on pages 15-58.
Plates i-x, inclusive, represent 186 named colors, hand-painted
(stencilled).

[2] Titles of several books on the subject which are especially
recommended to the lay student of chromatology are given at the end of
this text.

22, 1895, pp. 390-392.

[4] According to Aubert more than 1000 hues are distinguishable in the
spectrum, though among them all the hues between violet and red are
wanting.

[5] That is to say, the practical limit for pictorial representation of
the colors in their various modifications.

[7] See colored figure on frontispiece.

[8] See the colored figure on the frontispiece of this work, which
clearly illustrates this method of color measurement. Larger disks
of spectrum red, green, and violet are interlocked and adjusted so
that they present, respectively, 32, 42, and 26 per cent. of the
circumference; superimposed on these is a single smaller disk of
neutral gray, and on this two still smaller disks of black and white,
the former occupying 79, the latter 21, per cent. of the area. The
result of this combination of colors, when the disks are rapidly
revolved, is that the entire surface becomes a uniform neutral gray
precisely like the middle disk, which blends so completely with the
color inside and outside its limits that no trace of division can be
detected. Hence, neutral gray equals a combination of red 32, green
42, and violet 26 per cent., and also equals a combination of black
79 and white 21 per cent. As further illustrating the point, it may
be mentioned that not only does the above-mentioned combination
of the three primary colors equal neutral gray but so also does
the combination of any color ("secondary" or "tertiary" as well as
primary) with its complementary, though the darkness or lightness
of the gray varies somewhat, as the following table shows:

  Spectrum Color.       Complementary Color.            Equivalent Gray.

  Name.  Per Cent.   Per Cent.     Composition.          Black.   White.

  Red     44          56      Blue 41 + Green 59.         72.5     27.5
  Orange  28.5        71.5    Blue 51.5 + Green 48.5.     69       31
  Yellow  33          67      Blue 60.5 + Violet 39.5.    64       36
  Green   51          49      Red 57.5 + Violet 42.5.     73       27
  Blue    64          36      Yellow 82 + Orange 18.      62       37
  Violet  62.5        37.5    Yellow 69 + Green 31.       61.5     38.5

[9] The number is doubled so that every other one represents an
intermediate hue not shown in color.

[10] Owing to the circumstance that spectrum orange does not, at
least when mixed with gray, fairly represent a medium hue between red
and orange, being much nearer the former, a hue much near to yellow
(yellow-orange, No. 15) has been selected.

[11] For satisfactory color-wheel work it is necessary to discard
practically all the so-called artists' colors, as being much too dull
to even approximately represent the colors of the spectrum, and to
substitute carefully selected aniline or coal-tar dyes, of which,
fortunately, there is a very large number of remarkable purity of hue.
Indeed, the work of most color-physicists is vitiated by their use of
such crude colors as vermilion, carmine, scarlet-lake, chrome yellow,
emerald green, Prussian blue, etc. (For a list of dyes and pigments
used in preparing the Maxwell disks representing the thirty-six colors
of the chromatic scale, see pages 26, 27.)

[12] In fixing the exact position or wave-length of the spectrum
colors considerable latitude is allowable, the element of "personal
equation"—that is, difference in the conception of different persons
as to just where the reddest red, greenest green, etc., are located,
accounting for the considerable disagreement among chromatologists as
to the wave-lengths. The following table, showing the average, mean,
and extreme wave-length of each of the spectrum colors as given by
nine or more authorities together with those of the present work (as
determined by Dr. P. G. Nutting, Associate Physicist of the U. S.
Bureau of Standards) is of interest in this connection:

                           Average        Extremes          Mean
            This work.     of 9-12         of 9-12         of 9-12
                         authorities.    authorities.    authorities.

  Red        644            6770          6440-7028        6734 (10)
  Orange     598 ± 2        6074          5892-6300        6096 (9)
  Yellow     577 ± 1        5786          5640-5850        5745 (10)
  Green      520 ± 10       5235          5050-5335        5193 (11)
  Blue       473 ± 3        4738          4520-4861        4680 (12)
  Violet     410            4176          4050-4330        4190 (10)

From this table it will be seen that the red of this work is
appreciably more orange than that of others, the orange slightly more
yellowish, and the violet a little less bluish than the average;
but the author is assured by Dr. Nutting that these standards are
exceptionally accurate.

[13] The percentages are given in tables on pages 23 and 25.

[14] That is to say, theoretically. Unfortunately it seems to be beyond
the colorists' skill to reproduce true shades of the pure colors, all
showing a more or less decided admixture of gray, resulting in a series
of broken or dull shades. (See pages 23 and 24.)

[15] Although only 1115 different colors are actually shown on
the plates the system is really equivalent to the presentation of
considerably more than 4000 distinguishable and designatable colors.

[16] The Theory of Color (American edition, 1876), p. 99.

[17] In the present work the possibility of variation between
different copies is wholly eliminated by a very different process of
reproduction. Each color, for the entire edition, is painted uniformly
on large sheets of paper from a single mixture of pigments, these
sheets being then cut into the small squares which represent the colors
on the plates.

a better Color Nomenclature. Milton Bradley Co., Springfield, Mass.

[21] Exception has been taken in a recent work ("A Color Notation,"
by A. H. Munsell) to the use of the term tone in this connection, on
the ground that its proper use belongs to music, and the term _value_
is substituted. The same line of reasoning would, however, certainly
require the discarding of _chromatic scale_ as a term of music
nomenclature, since its derivation is clearly from color (chroma).
Furthermore, the word "value" is even more elastic in its application
than tone, and, all things considered, the present writer, at least,
fails to see that any improvement is made by the proposed change.

[22] The term _chromatic scale_ has unfortunately been appropriated for
a very different use (in music); nevertheless it is strictly correct
in the present sense while in the other it is not, though firmly
established by long usage. The term _spectrum scale_ is not adequate,
as a substitute, because the spectrum series of colors is incomplete
through absence of the hues connecting violet with red, which are
necessary to show the full scale of pure colors and hues.

[23] The distinctions of color or hue diminishing in proportion to the
increased admixture of gray, each alternate color or hue, with its
scale (vertical) of tones, is omitted from the third and fourth series;
while in the fifth the color differentiation is so greatly reduced that
only the six spectrum colors (dulled by admixture of 95.5 per cent. of
neutral gray), together with purple (the intermediate between violet
and red) are given; a yellow orange hue being substituted for spectrum
orange because it is more exactly intermediate in hue between red and
yellow.

[24] J. J. Müller found that a mixture of the orange and violet rays
of the spectrum produced a whitish red (Rood, "Modern Chromatics," p.
129). The author of the present work, without being at the time aware
of this, produced an absolutely pure red (but of reduced intensity)
by mixture of either orange and violet (orange 63.5, violet 36.5 per
cent. = red 85 + white 15 per cent.), or from orange and the violet-red
which is complementary to green (violet-red 51, orange 49 per cent.),
the latter equaling red 89 + white 11 per cent; the mixtures being made
on a color-wheel with Maxwell disks representing the pure colors of the
present work. The red resulting from either of these mixtures on the
color-wheel is far purer than the blue resulting from mixture of green
and violet, and incomparably more so than the yellow resulting from
mixture of either red and green or orange and green. Consequently, if
the same results would come from mixing orange and violet light, it is
difficult to understand how red can be a primary color _according to
the accepted definition_.

[25] Rood: Modern Chromatics, p. 34.

With the single exception of Vanderpoel (Color Problems, p. 28,
plates 3, 4, where yellow is given first in order of luminosity) all
authorities on color-physics that I have been able to consult very
singularly ignore yellow entirely in their treatment of the subject of
luminosity.

CAUTION!!!

DO NOT EXPOSE THESE PLATES TO THE LIGHT FOR A LONGER TIME THAN IS
NECESSARY.


The pigments used in the preparation of these Plates are the most
durable known, those which have been proven unstable having been, as
far as possible, discarded. The latter include carmine and other
cochineal lakes, colors of vegetable origin (as gamboge, violet
carmine, indigo, etc.), and most of the aniline or coal tar dyes,
though among the last are a considerable number which are really more
permanent than several colors habitually used by artists. Certain
colors in this work could not, however, possibly be reproduced except
by the employment of pigments which are more or less sensitive to
_prolonged exposure_ to light, and hence this caution not to expose the
plates unnecessarily.

pages 257-263.)

EXPLANATION OF PLATES XXII AND XXIV.

Reference to these plates was unfortunately overlooked when the text
was going through the press.

These plates are simply _extras_. They were made at an early stage in
the preparation of the work and discarded; but were finally inserted,
merely to add to the number of colors represented.




Transcriber's Note

Underscores are used to mark _italic text_.

Equal signs are used to mark =bold text=.

Capital letters are used to represent SMALL CAPS.

The color sample for Light Corinthian Red on plate VVXII is missing
from the original book.
